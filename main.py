import turtle

WHAT THIS SHOULD DO:

Turtle should first make a background gradient (bg), before creating the shell's shape, *fill*, and *pattern*.

Next, the shell shape needs to be created and filled.
The bottom part is a rounded-corners rectangle, with an oval for the top. A triangle or sloped lines make ease the
connection. Variation in symmetry, size, shape can allow for more random versions.

A pattern can appear on the shell, from a preset number of pre-made designs. Out of these, the design can have a small
chance to not appear, or appear translucent behind the shell.

The fill and pattern for the shell will be filled with gradients.
All gradient colors will be of similar color, theme, shade, etc. so that they fit together.
    -This does not necessarily mean that the bg, fill, and pattern will all use same/similar colors.

The gradients used will be have their palettes pre-made, with random adjustments to shade to reduce exact copies
    -example: A purple/pink gradient is randomly chosen for the bg. Make slight adjustments to each color so that
    the next to select this bg will not have the exact same one
    
After an image is created, render it/export it/do whatever with it to make it appear as a 1080px^2 image (png) in an 
output folder.
